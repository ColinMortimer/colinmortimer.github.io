Hi, my name is Colin! I enjoy writing words and code, in which I am often found writing Tweets on <a href="https://twitter.com/ne0liberal">@ne0liberal</a> or code using <a href="https://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>. Less seriously, I enjoy traveling to countries off the beaten track, watching Tottenham Hotspur or observing flights criss cross the earth on <a> href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">FlightRadar24</a>.
