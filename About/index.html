<p>Hi, my name is Colin! I enjoy writing words and code, in which I am often found writing Tweets on <a href="https://twitter.com/ne0liberal">@ne0liberal</a> or code using <a href="https://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>. Less seriously, I enjoy traveling to countries off the beaten track, watching Tottenham Hotspur or observing flights criss cross the earth on <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">FlightRadar24</a>.</p>


<p>What are my goals? I believe that Liberalism as we know it needs to be redefined. That is to say, Liberalism is overwhelmingly a positive force, but it needs incremental reforms to stay competitive and relevant in the 21st century. If this is not done, it will fall to the wayside in favor of the reactionary Left and Right. Accomplishing this is in no way easy, but it can be broken down into a number of components:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>We have to redefine the city</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Zoning reform - also known as YIMBYism - has to occur so that more people can afford to live in cities</li>
            <li>Cities have to renegotiate their relationship with governments above them. Independent cities are more dynamic and better suited to flourish in the 21st centruy. See: charter cities</li>
        </ul>
    <li>We have to redefine democracy</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Gerrymandering overwhelmingly favors existing power structures and must be eliminated</li>
            <li>Even the in the absence of gerrymandering, the American electoral system overweeningly favors rural voter. This must be reformed.</li>

        </ul>
</ul>
